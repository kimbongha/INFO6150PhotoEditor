## Background and Proposal:
Based on social model nowadays, people tend to share their own daily activities by posting photos, especially young people. Before posting their photos, they always edit carefully by some software like Photoshop. Our team aimed to design and develop an online picture edit website. It is like online Photoshop, providing quicker and more convenient edit features. 

### As New Users:
Basic edit features almost meet my needs. I donâ€™t want to register or log in. I just want to make some small changes to my photos, then save the result and post to my own social platform.
1. Upload Photo: I can choose photos from my album in my phone. 
2. Drag & Scale: I can drag my photo to anywhere of my screen. I can also scale it to other sizes.
3. Cut: I can cut out the unwanted part of my photo.
4. Rotate: I can turn clockwise and counterclockwise. I can also flip it horizontally or vertically.

### As a Membership:
I need more advanced features to edit more details of my photos to make them subtle and unique.
1. Brightness / Contrast / Saturation / Sharpness: I can change the basic attributes of my photo.
2. Exposure / Highlights / Shadows: I can change the fine-tune of my photo.
3. Temperature / Tint: I can change the color details of my photo.
4. Resize: I can set my photo to another size, even by percentage.
5. Add Text: I can add some text above my photo to describe my feelings.
